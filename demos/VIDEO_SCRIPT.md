## 🎯 Script Outline

### INTRO (15 seconds)
**[Screen: Terminal with Vectro logo/banner]**

> "Hi! Today I'm showing you Vectro - an ultra-high-performance vector quantization library written in pure Mojo. It compresses LLM embeddings with 4x compression while maintaining 99.97% accuracy. Let's see it in action."

---

### SECTION 1: Quick Setup (20 seconds)
**[Screen: Terminal showing installation]**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wesleyscholl/vectro.git
cd vectro
pixi install
pixi shell
```

> "Installation is simple - just clone the repo, use pixi to set up the Mojo environment, and you're ready to go. Pixi handles all dependencies automatically."

---

### SECTION 2: Running the Demo (60 seconds)
**[Screen: Running benchmark demo]**

```bash
mojo run demos/benchmark_demo.mojo
```

**Show output highlighting:**

> "Let me run the comprehensive benchmark suite. Watch these metrics..."

**Point out key numbers as they appear:**

1. **Quantization Speed**
   - "Here we're processing 1000 vectors at different dimensions"
   - "At 768 dimensions - that's GPT-3.5 embedding size - we're hitting over 1 million vectors per second"
   - "Sub-millisecond latency per vector"

2. **Compression Quality**
   - "Now let's look at accuracy"
   - "Average error is only 0.03% - that means 99.97% accuracy"
   - "Your semantic search results stay virtually identical"

3. **Compression Ratio**
   - "Storage savings are impressive"
   - "3.98x compression ratio across all embedding sizes"
   - "That's 75% storage savings for your vector database"

4. **Batch Processing**
   - "Batch processing scales linearly"
   - "Whether you're processing 100 or 5000 vectors, throughput stays consistent"

---

### SECTION 3: Test Coverage (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Running test suite]**

```bash
mojo run tests/run_all_tests.mojo
```

**Show test output scrolling:**

> "Quality matters - Vectro has 100% test coverage. All 39 tests passing, every function validated, zero compiler warnings. This is production-ready code."

**[Screen: Show final coverage summary - 100%]**

---

### SECTION 4: Real-World Use Cases (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Show README or documentation]**

> "So where would you use this?"

**Display bullet points:**
- ✅ RAG pipelines - compress your vector stores
- ✅ Semantic search - 4x more vectors in memory
- ✅ Vector databases - reduce storage costs by 75%
- ✅ Edge deployments - smaller embeddings = faster sync

> "Anywhere you're working with LLM embeddings and need better performance or lower costs."

---

### SECTION 5: Why Mojo? (25 seconds)
**[Screen: Show language stats from GitHub]**

> "Why Mojo? Look at these numbers:"

**Show:**
- 98.2% Mojo
- 787K-1M vectors/sec
- Native SIMD optimization

> "Mojo gives us Python-like syntax with C-level performance. No FFI overhead, no Python interpreter bottleneck. Just blazing fast native code with modern language features."

---

### SECTION 6: Quick Code Walkthrough (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Show main quantizer code - maybe src/quantizer.mojo]**

> "The code is clean and readable. Here's the core quantization logic - find the max value, compute the scale, quantize to Int8. Simple, elegant, and the Mojo compiler optimizes it to incredibly fast SIMD instructions."

**Scroll through showing:**
- Clean function signatures
- Type safety
- SIMD operations

---

### OUTRO (20 seconds)
**[Screen: GitHub repo page]**

> "Vectro is open source, MIT licensed, ready for production use. Links are in the description - check out the repo, run the demos yourself, and if you're working with LLM embeddings, give it a try."

**Show:**
- GitHub: github.com/wesleyscholl/vectro
- 100% test coverage badge
- Performance metrics

> "Thanks for watching! Drop a star on GitHub if you found this useful, and let me know in the comments if you try it out!"

## 🎨 Visual Suggestions

### Terminal Theme
- Use a clean, high-contrast theme (e.g., Dracula, Nord)
- Larger font size for readability (14-16pt)
- Clear, uncluttered workspace

### Screen Recordings
1. **Intro**: Clean terminal with ASCII art banner
2. **Demo**: Full-screen terminal with benchmark output
3. **Tests**: Scrolling test results with green checkmarks
4. **Code**: Syntax-highlighted Mojo code
5. **Outro**: GitHub repo page

### Text Overlays
- Performance metrics as animated numbers
- Checkmarks for completed tests
- Arrows pointing to key numbers in output

### Background Music
- Upbeat, tech-focused (no lyrics)
- Low volume - don't overpower narration

---

## 🎥 Recording Tips

### Setup
- Record in 1080p or 4K
- 60fps for smooth scrolling
- Clear audio (use good mic, quiet room)

### Terminal Recording
```bash
# Use asciinema for perfect terminal recordings
asciinema rec vectro_demo.cast

# Or use OBS with good terminal font settings
```

### Editing
